To allocate to the bots suppoort discord server enter "$botinfo". Although you may be able to moderate users, features such as playing music, changing the prefix are currently under development.

2. You need a channel called "incidents" and this is where all the kick and ban logs will go

3. You also need a channel called "reports" and this is where all the reports sent by users will go.

Tip: As of now only people with "Manage Messages" can kick people and people with "Manage Members" can ban people.
